    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When we were kids, whenever my parents went out to an adults only party, my mother used to ask us what we wanted for dinner at home.<br> 99% of the time, our choice was pooris and shahi paneer. My mother was always nice enough to oblige. Here is the recipe. It is quite rich and hence a nice treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin and coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric and red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat</li>
    <li>Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart.</li>
    <li> Cook until the paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes</li>
    <li>tir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
